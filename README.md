# Datasets

Dataset of Mask Segementation and Inpainting: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RAcxpuBsmj8muouTK3NxlhAdcYvYTPT5) || [Mendeley](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zvr4jwvcrc/2)

Dataset for Gender Classification: [Gender Classified Dataset with Masked Face](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itsshuvra/gender-classified-dataset-with-masked-face)

# Experiments
We have used the Labelme software to create our dataset. You will find the mask segmentation dataset in the above link. Here is one example:

![Labelme](https://github.com/itsshuvra/A-Deep-Learning-Framework-to-Reconstruct-Face-under-Mask/blob/main/Results/Mask1.PNG)

We have perfectly detect the mask as an object. Here is the result you can see:

There is no edges on the face because we have detect the region of the mask properly.

Now, comparison with the ground truth of an image we know.

![Target Image](https://github.com/itsshuvra/A-Deep-Learning-Framework-to-Reconstruct-Face-under-Mask/blob/main/Results/Target1.PNG)

We have used [Adaptive WingLoss](https://github.com/protossw512/AdaptiveWingLoss) for Facial Landmark Calculation.

## Mask Segmentation Model:
We have used [Mask RCNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) to train our dataset. Saved Model Link: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-5GGKKmwG96W5PzqwMwT5hTvipERn0M3/view?usp=sharing)

## Gender Classification Model: 
We have used [Inception V3](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models/blob/master/inception_v3.py) pretrained model and used keras tuner to tune the model for our problem. We trained with the dataset of 89k images separately male and female.
