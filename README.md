# A Deep Learning Framework to Reconstruct Face under Mask
This github repo has just one module(Gender Classification)'s code of our research paper. We will update soon with the other modules code.

We have perfectly detect the mask as an object. Here is the result you can see:

There is no edges on the face because we have detect the region of the mask properly.

Now, comparison with the ground truth of an image we know.
